# Automated Monthly Cybersecurity Report Generator

## Overview
This project automates the extraction of data from PDF reports generated by Datto, processes and stores the extracted data in a local SQL database, and generates a structured, user-editable report in Microsoft Word (.docx) format. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of security, device performance, backup status, patch compliance, and recommendations for clients.

## Features
- Extraction of text and structured data from uploaded PDFs using `pdfplumber` and `Camelot`.
- Storage of extracted data in a local SQLite database (can be configured for other databases).
- Generation of a structured, user-editable report in .docx format.
- Customizable report template with branding elements.
- Logging and monitoring for security and integrity.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - Flask
  - SQLAlchemy
  - pdfplumber
  - camelot-py
  - opencv-python
  - python-docx
- SQL Database (SQLite by default, configurable in `config.py`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ZaneBrackley/ReportGenerator.git
cd ReportGenerator
```

2. Setup the Virtual Environment and install the required Python libraries:
```
source ./setup.sh
```

3. Configure your SQL database and connection settings in the `config.py` file.

4. Ensure the following folders exist in the root of the project:
- `temp` – Temporary folder for processing PDF files.
- `db` – Folder where the SQLite database will be stored.

## Usage
1. Run the Flask application to upload and process the reports:
```
python app/app.py
```
2. Upload the PDF's that were downloaded from Datto RMM.
  
3. The application will extract data from the PDFs, store it in the SQLite database, and generate a structured report in the root folder.

4. The application will also reset the database and clear existing records whenever new files are uploaded.
